Editor Navigation Shortcuts for Brackets
========================================
Adds Eclipse-style keyboard navigation to switch between open files:

* Press Cmd+Shift+E (Ctrl+Shift+E on Win) and start typing the name of an open file to jump to it
    * (This is different from Brackets' standard Quick Open command, which searches _all_ files in your project)
* Press Cmd+\[ or ] (Ctrl+\[ or ] on Win) to move to the next/previous file in the open files list
    * (This is different from Brackets' standard Ctrl+Tab shortcut, which navigates in MRU order)
